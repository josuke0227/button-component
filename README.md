Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

I'm completely noob to web development and ofcourse to using React too.
This time, I've learned about what "reusable" components are:
 * These must be less coupled to the user of the component.
 * Unite the many state of buttons on one go - e.g. "Disabled Button", "Text Style Button", etc.
Throughout this project, I learned:
 * CSS - grid layout
 * React - how to use props
